    "## Business Scenario: \n",
    "You've recently joined a retail analytics company as a junior data scientist. Your first project involves helping a national clothing retailer better understand their customer base to improve their marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing team has collected data about their customers' purchasing behaviors and demographics, but they're struggling to effectively segment customers for targeted promotions. They believe that \"similar\" customers should receive similar promotions, but they need your help to define and measure this similarity in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement different distance metrics to compare customers and identify which customers are most similar to each other based on their shopping behaviors and demographics. This will allow the marketing team to create more personalized and effective promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process you'll follow consists of these key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define what \"similarity\" means in the context of retail customers\n",
    "- Preprocess and normalize the customer data\n",
    "- Implement various distance metrics to compare customers\n",
    "- Analyze how different metrics affect customer similarity\n",
    "- Create a simple recommendation system based on customer similarity\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Annual income\n",
    "- Age\n",
    "- Years as customer\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "After comparing how different distance metrics find similar customers, the hybrid distance metric with weights works well for retail customer segmentation because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It balances overall similarity (from Euclidean distance) with spending pattern similarity (from Cosine distance), which is important for effective marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Euclidean component (0.4 weight) ensures we find customers with similar demographics and total spending capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Manhattan component (0.4 weight) provides robustness when customers have unusual spending in one category.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Cosine component (0.2 weight) helps identify customers with similar spending priorities (how they divide their budget), even if their total might differ spending differs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In our tests, the hybrid approach found customers who were both demographically similar and had similar purchasing behaviors, making it more practical for targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provided an exploration of distance metrics for customer similarity analysis in a retail context. By implementing and comparing Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine distance metrics, we demonstrated how different mathematical approaches to measuring similarity can yield different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metric selection matters: Each distance metric emphasizes different aspects of similarity. Euclidean distance captures overall profile similarity, Manhattan distance offers robustness to outliers, and Cosine distance identifies similar preferences regardless of scale.\n",
    "- Preprocessing is crucial: Proper handling of categorical variables through encoding and normalization of numerical features ensures fair comparison across different types and scales of data.\n",
    "- Hybrid approaches offer balance: Combining multiple distance metrics with appropriate weights can create a more comprehensive similarity measure that captures both absolute and proportional similarity.\n",
    "- Business context drives metric choice: The \"best\" distance metric depends on the specific business goals. For retail marketing, a hybrid approach balances spending capacity with customer preferences.\n",
    "- Practical applications: Distance-based similarity measures can directly power recommendation systems, helping businesses identify cross-selling opportunities based on similar customers' behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to customer similarity analysis provides retail businesses with a powerful tool for personalized marketing, inventory planning, and customer relationship management."
